    <div id="jonvinylexample"><h3>A&R & Fan Engagement: Jon Vinyl</h3>
        As a part of my internship with Warner Music Group, I, along with 3 teammates, were given the task to brainstorm a Fan Engagement campaign for a potential artist Warner Records should sign. This deck includes social media and streaming analytics, draft social media calendar, and an offline campaign idea that was led by me. <br> View the complete project deck <a href="../media/wmg_fanengagement_a&r.pdf>">here.</a> </div>

        For my senior capstone, I started a social media agency that offers affordable and personalized international marketing for independent musicians. I help my clients build their brand towards a global Chinese-speaking audience by creating and managing their Chinese social media accounts, and adhering the content to international culture and trends.

    <div><h3>Branding & Marketing Plan: Tiffany Young x #StayAtHome</h3>
        Individual project for my Business of Live Music & Experiential Brand Activation (BAN 245) class, in which I prepared on my childhood favorite artist, Tiffany Young. This deck was created during the pandemic with the focus of #StayAtHome, and thus is also titled the #StayAtHome marketing campaign. The project also includes a branding element, in which I created a brand pitch deck.

    <div><h3>Columnist: TMI.fm</h3>
        In September 2022, I was offered the opportunity to be a feature writer on TMI.fm, which is a Korean e-newsletter about technology, entertainment, and music industry. In <a href="https://maily.so/draft.briefing/posts?keyword=%EC%A1%B0%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4+%EC%B2%B8">"Joyce's Coffee Chat,"</a> I write about what I see and experience as an Asian studying music business in the States, news or trends that caught my eyes, etc.
