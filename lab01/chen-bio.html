    </head>
    <body>
        My name is Joyce Chen, and I am in the Bandier Program at Syracuse Universityâ€™s Newhouse School of Public Communications, which is a program for music business. Being a Taiwanese student in the States, I seek to maximize my cultural and language background at school and at work. In the future, I aim to work in developing global marketing strategies for artists and streamlining communications in the music industry. 

        In the past four years, I have accrued valuable experiences across international marketing, advertising, digital marketing, and music publishing. As a current senior, I am looking to expand my knowledge by taking classes related to web development, digital strategy and analytics, while working as a full-time intern at Warner Chappell Music. Outside of work, you may see me dancing with my friends, participating in badminton tournaments, practicing flute, or cooking in my dorm.
